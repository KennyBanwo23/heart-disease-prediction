## HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
For the prediction of Heart Disease, the dataset used was obtained from Kaggle. 
It consists of 13 attributes of 1025 patients.

## AIM OF THE PROJECT
To predict whether patients have heart disease or not using their medical attributes and to determine the model with the highest accuracy.

## DATA DICTIONARY
1. Age: Patients age in years
2. Sex: Sex of subject
3. CP: Chest pain type
4. Trestbps: Resting blood pressure
5. Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. FBS: Fasting blood sugar
7. Restecg: Resting Electrocardiograph
8. Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
9. Exang: Exercise Induced Angima
10. Oldpeak: ST Depression introduced by exercise
11. Slope: Slope of Peak Exercise ST segment
12. Ca: Number of major vessels
13. Thal: Defect type

## MODEL EVALUATION
Four model evaluation techniques were implemented in which accuracy was chosen as the best measure. The techniques were:
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1 Score

## PROCESS AND OUTCOME
Four machine learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes were used and KNN had the highest accuracy of 87%.
